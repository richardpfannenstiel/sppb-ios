# Short Physical Performance Battery iOS App

This app was built in the course of my Master's thesis concerning an automatic assessment of the Short Physical Performance Battery using vision-based human motion capturing technology.
It aims to enable untrained clinical staff to administer geriatric assessment, namely the standardized [Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)](https://doi.org/10.1093/geronj/49.2.M85).
The application takes over the test evaluation part by automatically assessing balance, gait and lower limb strength exercises.

> It uses [Google MLKit's Pose Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/pose-detection) which employs [BlazePose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10204) to obtain pose estimates of a patient's movements in real-time on mobile devices.
